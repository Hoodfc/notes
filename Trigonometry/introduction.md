## Trigonometry in right triangles

The ratios of the sides of a right triangle are called trigonometric rations. Three common trigonometric ratios are **sine(sin)**, **cosine(cos)** and **tangent(tan)**.

The terms _opposite, adjacent_ and _hypotenuse_ refer to the lengths of the sides

**Given** _DOG, **find** DG_

Taking the angle of value 72 as a reference, DO is its Opposite, and we have to find DG, which is the Hypotenuse of the triangle. Thus, we can do the following:

$$sin(72) = \frac{8.2}{DG}$$

$$DG * sin(72) = 8.2$$

$$DG = \frac{8.2}{sin(72)}$$

$$DG = 8.62$$
